    Bio: Hi there! My name is Kylie. Welcome to my website. Here you will find all of my projects and process from Design Technology 2, as well as other experimentations coding with HTML and CSS. A little bit about me, I enjoy doing crafts, cooking plant-based meals, journaling, going for walks, and hanging out with my friends. I'm looking forward to the sunshine and cherry blossoms this quarter and hope to spend more time outdoors. As for my design interests, I particularly enjoy branding, type, and packaging design. I'm excited about taking Packaging this quarter because it's a dream of mine to see a product I designed in a store someday! I regularly admire packaging while I'm out grocery shopping, browsing shops, or purchasing beauty products. Anyway, that's all for now. Thanks for visiting my page!
