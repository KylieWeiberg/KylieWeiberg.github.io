                <h2>Hi there, I'm Kylie. 
                <br>Welcome to my website!</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Here you will find all of my projects 
                    and process from DSGN 372, as well as 
                    other experimentations coding with HTML 
                    and CSS. A little bit about me, I enjoy 
                    doing crafts, cooking plant-based meals, 
                    journaling, going for walks, and hanging 
                    out with my friends. I'm looking forward 
                    to the sunshine and cherry blossoms this 
                    quarter and hope to spend more time outdoors. 
                    As for my design interests, I particularly 
                    enjoy branding, type, and packaging design. 
                    I'm excited about taking Packaging this quarter 
                    because it's a dream of mine to see a product 
                    I designed in a store someday! I regularly 
                    admire packaging while I'm out grocery shopping, 
                    browsing shops, or purchasing beauty products. 
                    Anyway, that's all for now. Thanks for visiting 
                    my page!

                <h3>Vitamins Packaging</h3>
                <p>
                    A fresh and fun redesign for a vitamin
                    brand called Align. With this project, 
                    I envisioned my product standing out on
                    the shelf of the vitamin aisle because of
                    its eye-catching color, simplicity, and 
                    fun personality. Catering towards younger
                    wellness-center individuals who enjoy taking
                    care of their health and enjoy following
                    health trends. My design utilizes bright
                    colors, bold type, and an engaging tone of voice.

                <h3>Zucko Brand Identity</h3>
                <p>
                    For this project, I was given a list of made-up 
                    brands to chose from and design a brand identity 
                    for. This brand identity includes a logo, website, 
                    social posts, packaging, and additional mockups. 
                    The made-up brand I chose was Zucko, a zucchini 
                    cooking oil brand. My vision for Zucko was a 
                    company that values clean and honest ingredients, 
                    targeting its audience toward health-conscious 
                    individuals. I also envisioned Zucko as a small 
                    business that grows their zucchinis on their 
                    farmstead and delivers their cooking oil to 
                    grocery stores. Zucko is a lively, enthusiastic 
                    brand that you can rely on as your go-to healthy 
                    cooking oil alternative.

                <h3>Goodreads UI Redesign</h3>
                <p>
                    During this UI project, I was tasked to give a 
                    “makeover” to an outdated mobile application of 
                    my choice using Figma. After undergoing light 
                    research and testing, I designed a fresh and new 
                    visual aesthetic for the app, Goodreads. This 
                    makeover includes reworking the user flow and 
                    a reapplication of the branding including 
                    typography, buttons, colors, grid/layout, icons, 
                    UI components, and photos. My goal was to redirect
                    Goodreads target audience towards younger readers
                    who want to explore and share their books with 
                    their friends.
